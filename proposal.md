# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

DISCORD REDDIT/MEME BOT
## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

A discord bot that will send memes from reddit into the discord chat.

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

The plan is to first create a functional discord bot. Then if that is easier than we thought it will be we plan on making the bot do more things. For example, 
have the bot send more than just memes from reddit, maybe from other sources of memes. Have the bot send other types of media (videos, gifs, etc). We are using python
to code the bot. We plan to execute this plan by creating commands for the bot to do what we intend it to do.

## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

TODO, if applicable

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

Create a FUNCTIONAL (Runs and does literally anything) discord bot.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

Have the bot be able to send links from reddit in the chat channel.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

The bot is able to get posts from not just reddit and copy and paste the link or image into the channel, and the bot can specifically look for memes on specific subreddits. 

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

Our next steps are to, first learn how to create the discord bot and have it working. Then we have to create commands for the bot to follow.
Then we have to research how to get the bot to access reddit or any other website. After that it is a matter of writing the code to do everything. 
The way we want to divide the up the work is to first get the bot to access reddit and then everyone will work on different aspects of the reddit bot.
For example, someone will work on getting the bot to be able to search through different subreddits.
someone will work on the bot getting the link, image, or video from a reddit post.
For the most part we plan on making this a fully collaborative effort, meaning everyone will probably work on everything at the same time.
